# nvim config

## Some things to note:
- This setup expects some programs to be installed on your system, or else you'll have weird errors.
  One prickly example is `fd`, which on some systems (such as ubuntu), is installed  as `fdfind`, and may not be available to telescope, even though it's installed. You should make sure `fd` is available on your system as `fd`.
