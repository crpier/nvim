# nvim config

## Some things to note:
- This setup expects some programs to be installed on your system, or else you'll have weird errors.
  One prickly example is `fd`, which on some systems (such as ubuntu), is installed  as `fdfind`, and may not be available to snacks picker, even though it's installed. You should make sure `fd` is available on your system as `fd`. (e.g. via symlink)


## TODOs
- Should mention in CLAUDE.md my preferences for lazy loading (i.e. plugins should mention some triggers to load, like keymaps or filetypes, or commands, or nothing fits the `VeryLazy` event)
